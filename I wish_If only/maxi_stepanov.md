1. I wish you came earlier, then you can figure out how lameness architectural decision  suggested by the first-year student  

2. If only you had waited until he came, otherwise we know on which step project right now and what we are going to do next.
 
3. I wish I had a chance to met you before leaving and discussed the reason for your dismissal. I have a lot of thoughts about it and I want to share it with you.

4. I wish the project hadn’t ended before it started since under-staffed and funding. If everything had gone well, the idea would have been the best on the market and became a new hit. 

5. I wish I hadn’t come and brought a friend.  If I were him, I wouldn’t do that. If had come in time, it wouldn’t have happened.

6. Without you, I haven’t known what to answer to the client, you led the conversation in a different way, and we avoided a serious conversation about the deadline.

7. I wish I read this book in the original, in this case, I could learn new trends in the world of software development from the source, without waiting a lot of years for a translation.

8. I wish I had enough time, otherwise, I could set up a chic architecture and implemented the project my best. Do you have relevant experience? Nope, but I read a lot about it. 

9. I wish I could go with you to the bar tonight, I have a lot of work on the work

10. I wish I had the feedback about content and the lesson itself, then I know my weaknesses.
