Make no mistakes, you do the right things. I've found out how to work with git ;)

# My wish
I wish I had more opportunities to translate.
If only I could find out what kind of a word is correct to put into a sentence. There are a lot collocations, synonyms in English - I sometimes find myself being upset and frustrated about that.
